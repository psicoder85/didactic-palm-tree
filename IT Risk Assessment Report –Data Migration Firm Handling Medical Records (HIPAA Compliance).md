# IT Risk Assessment Report – Data Migration Firm Handling Medical Records (HIPAA Compliance)

## 1. Executive Summary
This IT Risk Assessment has been conducted for a mid-sized data migration and cloud transformation provider preparing to onboard a new healthcare sector client. The client will entrust the company with the migration, transformation, and secure storage of medical records containing sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI). 

As the nature of the data significantly elevates compliance obligations, this assessment focused on identifying and mitigating IT risks directly related to confidentiality, integrity, and availability of health records. The objective is to ensure compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), along with other relevant frameworks such as NIST SP 800-66, ISO/IEC 27701, and CIS Controls.

The scope includes infrastructure, data migration procedures, storage and access policies, vendor management, and endpoint protection. The findings below highlight critical and high-priority risks associated with technical, administrative, and physical safeguards. Recommendations focus on enhancing access controls, encryption practices, audit logging, breach notification readiness, and third-party oversight.

## 2. Objective
To evaluate the readiness and risk exposure of the company’s technical and operational controls in anticipation of handling medical records subject to HIPAA, and to ensure adherence to related industry standards.

## 3. Methodology
- **Frameworks Used:** HIPAA Security Rule, NIST SP 800-66, ISO/IEC 27001:2022, ISO/IEC 27701, CIS Controls v8
- **Assessment Type:** Compliance and Risk-Based Assessment
- **Tools:** Document review, control walkthroughs, interviews, vulnerability scan reports
- **Stakeholders:** Legal & Compliance, DevOps, Security Engineering, Risk Management, Project Management Office

## 4. Scope
- Data migration and storage tools
- PHI handling policies and technical procedures
- User access and privilege management
- Third-party services (cloud providers, backup vendors)
- Endpoint security and encryption practices

## 5. Risk Identification & Evaluation

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Existing Controls | Risk Owner |
|--------|------------------|------------|--------|------------|-------------------|------------|
| R1 | Insufficient encryption of PHI at rest | High | High | Critical | Manual encryption on select systems | DevOps |
| R2 | Weak access controls on migration tools | High | High | Critical | Shared credentials used for migration scripts | IAM Team |
| R3 | Absence of breach notification procedures | Medium | High | High | No formal incident response playbook | Compliance Team |
| R4 | Unverified third-party subcontractors | Medium | High | High | No BAAs signed or vendor risk assessments | Legal |
| R5 | Lack of audit logging for file access | Medium | Medium | Medium | File system logs not centrally collected | Security Ops |
| R6 | Insecure file transfers (FTP usage) | Medium | High | High | Legacy systems still use FTP for batch uploads | DevOps |
| R7 | Incomplete training on HIPAA awareness | High | Medium | High | New staff not yet trained on PHI handling | HR & Compliance |
| R8 | Inconsistent backup encryption | Low | High | Medium | Some backups not encrypted or tested | IT Infrastructure |
| R9 | Misconfigured cloud storage permissions | Medium | High | High | Public access on a testing S3 bucket | Cloud Admin |
| R10 | Lack of role-based access for PHI | High | Medium | High | All migration engineers have full data access | IAM & Security Teams |

## 6. Prioritization & Recommendations

### Priority 1: PHI Encryption Deficiencies (R1)
- Deploy full-disk encryption across all storage and backup locations
- Apply AES-256 encryption for databases storing PHI
- Integrate encryption into DevOps CI/CD pipelines

----

### Priority 2: Access Control Gaps (R2, R10)
- Implement RBAC based on least privilege
- Enforce MFA and unique credentials for each migration engineer
- Centralize access reviews and audits monthly

----

### Priority 3: Incident Response and Notification (R3)
- Create HIPAA-compliant incident response plan
- Conduct tabletop breach simulations quarterly
- Define breach impact thresholds and response times

----

### Priority 4: Vendor Oversight and Legal Compliance (R4)
- Ensure all vendors handling PHI sign HIPAA BAA contracts
- Conduct annual vendor risk assessments
- Maintain a vendor risk register

------

### Priority 5: Secure Data Transmission (R6)
- Replace all FTP protocols with SFTP or HTTPS APIs
- Enforce TLS 1.2 or higher for all data transfers

-----

### Priority 6: Audit Logging and Monitoring (R5)
- Centralize logs to SIEM with access monitoring rules
- Enable file access logs on all systems containing PHI

-----

### Priority 7: Cloud Security Misconfigurations (R9)

-----

## 7. Conclusion
To meet HIPAA and related regulatory obligations, the company must address the identified high-risk areas through encryption, access control enforcement, and vendor due diligence. Automation, documentation, and consistent training are key to maintaining a mature risk posture. Addressing these risks not only ensures compliance but builds trust with healthcare clients and enhances business continuity.
